 * Back to the two gymnastics teams, the Dolphins and the Koalas! There is a new gymnastics discipline, which works differently.       *
 * Each team competes 3 times, and then the average of the 3 scores is calculated (so one average score per team).                     *
 * A team only wins if it has at least double the average score of the other team.                                                     *
 * Otherwise, no team wins!                                                                                                            *
 *                                                                                                                                     *
 *                          1. Create an arrow function 'calcAverage' to calculate the average of 3 scores                             *
 *                          2. Use the function to calculate the average for both teams                                                *
 *                          3. Create a function 'checkWinner' that takes the average score of each team as parameters ('avgDolhins'   *
 *                             and 'avgKoalas'), and then logs the winner to the console, together with the victory points, according  *
 *                             to the rule above.                                                                                      *
 *                             Example: "Koalas win (30 vs. 13)"                                                                       *
 *                          4. Use the 'checkWinner' function to determine the winner for both Data 1 and Data 2                       *
 *                          5. Ignore draws this time                                                                                  *
